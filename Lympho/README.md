# Lymphography dataset

## Dataset information
The original lymphography dataset from UCI machine learning repository is a classification dataset. It is a multi-class dataset having four classes, but two of them are quite small (2 and 4 data records). Therefore, those two small classes are merged and considered as outliers compared to other two large classes (81 and 61 data records).
